Since she was eleven, she has been attending ISDA youth training camps. She is the only one to have attended four and was quickly spotted by the organisation for her courage and dedication.<br><br>As a student in planetology and now a teacher at SUPAERO in Toulouse, she has managed both her schooling and her intensive training.<br><br>Supported by her grandfather, she has always kept her goals in mind since she was 4 years old.<br><br>Today her efforts are paying off as she has been selected for the Oympus III mission, which aims to land on Mars, what a joy! We are going to share this epic journey with her."

When she was six years old, she came face to face with the Red Planet and was hypnotised, her passion for the planet began.<br>She said to her grandfather at that moment: 'Grandpa, I want to be an astronaut and be one of the people who go to Mars'.

      "description": "The search for life on Mars is a fascinating and eventful story, and it is a testament to the inescapable attraction we have for this multifaceted planet.<br><br>Numerous studies and missions have been carried out to learn more about our neighbour.<br><br>On 12 April 1963, a spectrographic analysis of the planet was carried out to determine whether its atmosphere contained water. The results were not very encouraging, revealing that the thin layer of gas surrounding Mars contains only a tiny fraction of water, much less than over the driest deserts on Earth. But this discovery did not stop researchers from exploring. In July 1965, the Mariner spacecraft captured the first photographs of the Martian surface during its flyby. At the time, the black and white images showed a deserted world, studded with craters and empty of all channels.<br><br>On 20 July 1976, Viking 1 was the first human aircraft to land on the Martian surface. The mission, which was originally intended to last only 90 days, was to last six years, during which time an impressive amount of images and meteorological data were collected and various experiments were conducted.<br><br>In 2015, when the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter provided the first evidence of liquid water on the surface of Mars, the planet became popular again, and the film The Martian inspired a whole new generation of budding astronauts. The Curiosity rover, which has been exploring the Martian surface since 2012, has since provided new evidence suggesting that the Red Planet may indeed have hosted life.<br><br>Finally, Mars 2020 is the latest mission to search for traces of life on the Red Planet. It reached its destination on 18 February 2021 and on board was the Perseverance rover. During its 18-month primary mission, which is expected to be extended, it will collect several soil cores from different sites chosen for their geological characteristics."
