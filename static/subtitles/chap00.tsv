00:00:03	Hi Grandpa, it's Emilie.
00:00:04	I couldn't reach you. But... I did it.
00:00:02	Finally... we succeeded.
00:00:02	
00:00:06	I feel so good and ready to take the plunge. Do you think we'll see each other again?
00:00:04	
00:00:05	My doubts are surfacing, I am lost. I would have liked so much to see you again before this great departure.
00:00:02	
00:00:02	We have worked together for so long to get to this point.
00:00:02	It's thanks to you, I can't thank you enough.
00:00:10	
00:00:05	I hope you are proud of me. I have a long journey ahead of me, and I know you'll be there with me.
00:00:02	
00:00:04	I was finally summoned, and would be the first to set foot on Mars.
